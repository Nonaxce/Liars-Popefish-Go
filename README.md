# 🐟 Liars-Popoefish-Go 🃏

A little card game created by a group of dorks for the purpose of wanting to create one for fun :D.

## Rules 🎲

-   All players have 2 lives.
-   All players are given 5 cards ( 3 from go fish and 2 from poker).

-   Turns go just as in go fish.

-   Players are able to reserve their turns to be used
    On another turn.

-   Players are able to "bluff" (lie) when they are asked for a certain card.

-   After a players turn, a card is put into the river.
    -river must be played on a keyboard

-   You are able to call "liar" to the person asking you or the person you asked:

-Players are able to call "Liar" when they suspect someone is lying about their hand.

-Players are also able to call "liar" when they think the asking player is asking for a card that they dont have or cant make a pair out of.

-   (Before the show of hands, the liar or bluffer are able to give the card they were asked instead of initiating the poker game, basically forfeiting their bluff)

-   Players then show their hands then have to use there current hand in poker.

-   Loser has to play russian roulette.

-   If they survive, all players swap out their cards for new ones.

-   The surviving player then take the next action and draws a card.

-   If they lose, they lose a life.

-   If a player manages to reduce their hand to 0, all other players lose a life.

-   Game loops until all other players have no lives
